# Fullerene

## Introduction
 
Fullerene aims to create a 3D environment where the user can build and explore their own molecules and experiment with their molecular and atomic geometry in an accurate and detailed simulation.

### Current Features
* Basic (non-cyclical) molecule creation
* General framework for lone pair geometry, ions, and other more advanced molecular concepts

### Planned Features
* Variable charge/ion support (Including transition metals and lanthanides/actinides)
* Prebuilt molecules for users to build and learn from
* Sandbox mode for users to make their own molecules.
* VR device support
* Fun mini-games to test user's knowledge.
