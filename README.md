# Fullerene

## Introduction
 
Fullerene aims to create a 3D environment where the user can build and explore their own molecules and experiment with their molecular and atomic geometry in an accurate and detailed simulation.

* Simulation stems from integration with Avogrado.cc (WIP)
* Prebuilt molecules for users to build and learn from
* Sandbox mode for users to make their own molecules.
* VR device support
* Fun mini-games to test user's knowledge.
